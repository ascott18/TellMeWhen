= How To: Create a Condition

This page serves as a simple guide on how to use the ConditionCategory API.


== Get the Category.

The first thing you need to do is call CNDT:GetCategory(). If you know the category you are wanting to get already exists, you can omit all parameters except the first (identifier).

<<code lua>>
-- Create a new category
local ConditionCategory = CNDT:GetCategory("CUSTOMCAT", 20, L["CNDTCAT_CUSTOMCAT"], true, false)
<</code>>

To check if a category already exists, look in CNDT.CategoriesByID[identifier].

<<code lua>>
local ConditionCategory
if CNDT.CategoriesByID["ATTRIBUTES_PLAYER"] then
  ConditionCategory = CNDT:GetCategory("ATTRIBUTES_PLAYER")
else
  error("Category not defined!")
end
<</code>>


== Create the Condition

Next, define the condition that you wish to create using [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-category/|ConditionCategory]]{{{:RegisterCondition()}}}

See the documentation of that function and the [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-data-specification|Condition Data Specification]] for more information.

Some of the more complex fields & functions are described in greater detail below.


=== Funcstr

The {{{funcstr}}} field is what actually makes your condition do what it does. Its contents should evaluate to a single boolean value. If you need any sort of complex logic, you will probably need to write an external function in the {{{Env}}} table and reference that from within your funcstr. You should avoid using an external function if you can, though, since doing so will increase CPU usage.

Funcstr, when compiled with other conditions into a full function, will look something like this:
<<code lua>>
local ConditionObject = ... 
return (
     ((1 == IsResting()) -- 1_RESTING
    and(UnitHealth("player")/(UnitHealthMax("player")+epsilon) <= 0.48)) -- 2_HEALTH
    or (AuraDur("player", "serendipity", "serendipity", "HELPFUL", time) > 1.8) -- 3_BUFFDUR
    
)
<</code>>

The icon and conditions that were the source of the above generated code:
<<code none>>
^1^T^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SRESTING ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^t^N2^T ^SType^SHEALTH ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S<= ^SLevel^N48 ^t^N3^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SOperator^S> ^SName^SSerendipity ^SLevel^N1.8 ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^Sn^N3 ^t^t^N62025^S~`~| ^Sicon^^
<</code>>

Take note that the condition checker function takes advantage of Lua's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation|Short-circuit Evaluation]] so that only the least amount of conditions are actually checked before Lua can be certain of the state of the entire condition set.


=== Events

The {{{events}}} function allows the condition to tell a [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]] what events can be listened to in order to make sure the condition stays updated.

There are two parts to this:

==== Requesting Events

The first job of the {{{events}}} function is to request the events that will be needed to keep the conditions updated. This is done automatically when using [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:GenerateNormalEventString()}}} and [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:GetUnitChangedEventString()}}}, but it can also be done manually by calling [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:RequestEvent()}}} and [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:SetNumEventArgs()}}} together.


==== Generating Arg Checker Strings

The second job of the {{{events}}} function is to return strings of Lua that will be used to check the args of events that are requested to determine if an update should be preformed. These are generated automatically when using [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:GenerateNormalEventString()}}} and [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:GetUnitChangedEventString()}}}, but the {{{events}}} function still must return them.

You also can create these manually. They look something like this:

<<code lua>>
-- E.g. #1:
"event == 'PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING'"

-- E.g. #2:
"event == 'UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT' and arg1 == 'player'"
<</code>>

Event args can be accessed through variables named "arg1", "arg2", etc. assuming that the proper number of args have been requested using [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:SetNumEventArgs()}}}. When generating event strings manually, it is also important to requested the needed events using [[api/conditions/api-documentation/condition-object/|ConditionObject]]{{{:RequestEvent()}}}.


=== Anticipate

The {{{anticipate}}} function lets an event-driven condition calculate when its next update should be preformed based on the settings of the condition it is checking and the current gameplay state (length of cooldowns, time remaining on buffs, etc).

It should be a string that represents a full Lua chunk. The only thing that it needs to do is declare a local variable named "VALUE" (which will be renamed by the condition compiler) at the top level of the chunk's scope and assign a number to that variable. The number assigned should either be 0 (or any value less than the curret time) or {{{math.huge}}} if no update is needed at any point in the forseeable future, or a number comparable to {{{TMW.time}}} and {{{GetTime()}}} that represents the time at which the condition should be updated next.

The most common logic that you will be using in this chunk is to figure out the time at which the gameplay element that you are tracking (E.g a cooldown, buff/debuff, totem, etc.) will expire, and then subtract the time that the user has set for the condition from that value.

An example of this can be seen in the Spell Cooldown condition, among many others:

<<code lua>>
anticipate = [[
  local start, duration = GetSpellCooldown(c.GCDReplacedNameFirst)
  local VALUE = duration and start + duration - c.Level or huge
]]
<</code>>

In the above code, {{{start + duration}}} will give the time that the cooldown will finish, and {{{ - c.Level}}} will subtract the user-set "time of interest" from that amount to get the desired time for the next condition update.

If the cooldown is not valid, {{{VALUE}}} will be assigned {{{math.huge}}}, which means that no update is requested for the forseeable future.

If the cooldown is ready, {{{start}}} and {{{duration}}} will both be 0, so the value returned must be less than or equal to 0, which also means that no update is requested for the forseeable future.


=== Events & Anticipate Together

The event handler function, which contains the arg checker strings, is combined with the anticipate function. That means that any time an event is handled, the anticipator code will also be called and the next update will be scheduled.

Here is an example of a fully compiled function:
<<code lua>>
local ConditionObject, event, arg1 = ... 
if (not event or 
  (event == 'UNIT_AURA' and arg1 == 'player') or 
  (event == 'PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING') or 
  (event == 'SPELL_UPDATE_USABLE') or 
  (event == 'SPELL_UPDATE_COOLDOWN') or 
  (event == 'UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT' and arg1 == 'player') or 
  (false) or 
  (event == 'PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD') or 
  (event == 'UNIT_MAXHEALTH' and arg1 == 'player') 
) then
  
  -- Anticipator #1
  local start, duration = GetSpellCooldown("fade")
  local ANTICIPATOR_RESULT1 = duration and start + (duration - 0) or huge
  
  if ANTICIPATOR_RESULT1 <= time then
    ANTICIPATOR_RESULT1 = huge
  end
  
  -- Anticipator #2
  local dur, duration, expirationTime = AuraDur("player", "renew", "renew", "HELPFUL", time)
  local ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2
  if dur and dur > 0 then
    ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2 = expirationTime and expirationTime - 7 or 0
  else
    ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2 = 0
  end            
  if ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2 <= time then
    ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2 = huge
  end
  
  -- Calculate next update time:
  local nextTime = min(ANTICIPATOR_RESULT1,ANTICIPATOR_RESULT2)
  if nextTime == 0 then
    nextTime = huge
  end
  ConditionObject.NextUpdateTime = nextTime    
  
  -- Don't check the condition or request an immediate check if event is nil
  -- since event is only nil when manually calling from within :Check()
  if not event then return end
  
  -- Check the condition:
  if ConditionObject.doesAutoUpdate then
    ConditionObject:Check()
  else
    ConditionObject.UpdateNeeded = true
  end
end
<</code>>

You may have noticed the line in the if ... then segment that essentially checks {{{if (false) then ...}}}. That is just an idiosyncrasy that arises when a condition checks the unit "player". It doesn't cause any negative effects - it is simply a placeholder that gets substituted in when there is no event to be checked.

Here is the icon and conditions that generated this function:
<<code none>>

= Full Example

Here is the full code for the Buff - Duration condition, which contains many of the ideas and concepts that were explained in this guide:

<<code lua>>
ConditionCategory:RegisterCondition(1,   "BUFFDUR", {
  text = L["ICONMENU_BUFF"] .. " - " .. L["DURATION"],
  range = 30,
  step = 0.1,
  name = function(editbox) TMW:TT(editbox, "BUFFTOCHECK", "BUFFCNDT_DESC") editbox.label = L["BUFFTOCHECK"] end,
  useSUG = true,
  check = function(check) TMW:TT(check, "ONLYCHECKMINE", "ONLYCHECKMINE_DESC") end,
  formatter = TMW.C.Formatter.TIME_0ABSENT,
  icon = "Interface\\Icons\\spell_nature_rejuvenation",
  tcoords = CNDT.COMMON.standardtcoords,
  funcstr = function(c)
    return [[AuraDur(c.Unit, c.NameFirst, c.NameName, "HELPFUL]] .. (c.Checked and " PLAYER" or "") .. [[", time) c.Operator c.Level]]
  end,
  events = function(ConditionObject, c)
    return
      ConditionObject:GetUnitChangedEventString(CNDT:GetUnit(c.Unit)),
      ConditionObject:GenerateNormalEventString("UNIT_AURA", CNDT:GetUnit(c.Unit))
  end,
  anticipate = function(c)
    return [[local dur, duration, expirationTime = AuraDur(c.Unit, c.NameFirst, c.NameName, "HELPFUL]] .. (c.Checked and " PLAYER" or "") .. [[", time)
    local VALUE
    if dur and dur > 0 then
      VALUE = expirationTime and expirationTime - c.Level or 0
    else
      VALUE = 0
    end]]
  end,
})
