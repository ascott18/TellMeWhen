 ** Bug Fixes:
 ** Designed a new protocol for sharing class spells to prevent the old version of it that was dramatically errored from leaking into a new version of it.

 ** Icon Color Flash animations should now work correctly.
 ** Rewrote (but mostly just refactored) the database initialization process so that it runs in a much more logical fashion, and also so it allows for upgrades in the "global" DB namespace to run when they are supposed to.
 ** Rewrote (but mostly just refactored) event configuration code.
 ** The [Opacity] tag should now properly return a number instead of a boolean.
 ** Added Mind Quickening to the IncreasedSpellHaste equivalency

 * New icon display method: Bars.
 * New icon type: Loss of Control (WoW 5.1+ only)
 * You may notice some slight changes to the way your text layouts appear, especially if you used the Constrain Width setting. You will have to re-adjust your old layouts to achieve old functionality, which will probably require adding a second anchor to any affected text displays.

 * The "Class Colored Names" setting was removed due to internal conflicts with DogTag and the implementation of this setting.
 * Bug Fixes:

 ** Fix attempted for GroupModule_GroupPosition\Config.lua line 47: attempt to index local 'Module' (a nil value)

 ** A Special note: r450 concludes a series of 9 bogus commits that were made in order to restore the revision number of the repo back to where it was before the data loss that struck CurseForge's SVN repos on 11/7 **
 
===v6.0.3===
 * Re-implemented the stance condition for paladin seals.

 * Added a setting to make colors ignore the GCD. It is enabled by default.
 * Added center text as a default text layout.
 * New condition: Unit is Player.

 ** Fixed a bug where profiles of version 60032 or earlier could not be imported by version 60033 or later.

===v6.0.2===

===v6.0.1===
 * Bug fix: Fixed positioning issues when using Masque.
 
===v6.0.0===
 * This is by and large the biggest update that TMW has ever seen. There were so many changes that I lost track of them. Here are a few:
 * Full support for Mists of Pandaria. If anything is missing, please open a ticket.
 
 * Almost everything in TMW is now modular. The most immediate effect of this is that the main tab in the icon editor is now divided into panels for each component that is contributing to an icon.
 * Implemented LibDogTag as the text manager for TMW instead of TMW's old (and very limited) system. You can now create text layouts that can be applied to an icon to dictate how the texts for that icon will be displayed.
 * You can now specify a new set of conditions that are attached to the units that an icon checks. This is the replacement for the now-removed ability to track "%u" as a unit in icon conditions.
 * You can now select any of the 4 sound channels to play sounds to (instead of just Master and SFX).
 * You can now list specific totems to be checked by totem icons.
 * Added On Left Click and On Right Click event handlers to icons.
 * You can now change the direction that icons layout in within a group.
 * Spell Crit is now an event that can be tracked by Combat Event icons.
 
 * New Conditions:
 ** Added a condition to check if you have your mouse over a frame (group or icon).
 ** Added conditions to check if you have a certain glyph active.
 ** Added a condition to check the creature type (Undead, Humanoid, Demon, etc.) of a unit.
 
 * There are many, many more changes not listed here. I recommend that you just start configuring TellMeWhen to see what all has changed.

===v5.0.2===
 * Bug Fixes:
 ** (r485) (Condition): attempt to call global "GetEclipseDirection" (a nil value)

===v5.0.1===
 * Bug Fixes:
 ** (r483) Unit Cooldown icons checking spells by name should now function properly.
 ** (r483) Cooldown sweeps and other icon components are no longer anonymous frames, returning to their previous nomenclature appended by an underscore and the icon's view type (Currently only "icon", more coming soon)
 ** (r483) Fixed a faulty upgrade of the "PassThrough" setting when upgrading past 50035. Settings that already had this faulty upgrade occur may notice that the "Pass Through" setting on some of their events was toggled from checked to unchecked.

===v5.0.0===
 * Super cool changes:
 ** All icon types have been changed to be entirely event based, meaning that they will no longer update themselves when they don't need to, resulting in a (tremendous) performance increase.
 ** The Condition engine has been completely rewritten and is now almost entirely event driven, resulting in another (tremendous) performance increase.
 ** Events have been completely rewritten to allow an unlimited amount of handlers to be created for an icon (instead of one text, one sound, and one animation per event per icon as previously).
 ** You can now sort all of the icons of a group based on attributes like duration, stacks, and opacity.

 * Pretty cool changes:
 ** You can now check units relative to the special condition unit '%u' (//for example, '%u-target' or '%upettarget'//).
 ** There is now an option (enabled by default) to color the names of units in text displays and outputs.
 ** Added slash commands to easily enable or disable icons and groups.
 ** Added Floating Combat Text as a text output.
 ** Added two new animations: Icon Border and Icon Image Overlay.
 ** You can now press tab to insert the first entry that is displayed in the suggestion list.

 * Really boring changes:
 ** The icon listing in dropdowns for meta icons, condition icons, and others is now much prettier and more informative.
 ** Enrage is now a proper dispel type, and no longer relies on a pre-defined list of enrages.
 ** Implemented a proper class-based inheritance system for many objects (Icons, Icon Types, Groups, Condition Groups).
 ** Icons that check units now have their units managed behind the scenes whenever possible so that icons aren't trying to check units that don't exist.
 ** You can now drag spells and items to the Custom Texture editbox to easily insert the texture of that spell or item.
 ** Power bars and Timer bars have been shipped out into their own files, so a completely restart will be needed if you want to use them.

 * Bug Fixes:
 ** (r427) (Condition):  attempt to call global 'GetPrimaryTalentTree' (a nil value)
 ** (r428) (Condition):  attempt to call global 'IsResting' (a nil value)

 ** (r441) TellMeWhen-5.0.0.lua:3572: attempt to compare nil with number
 ** (r442) (Not really a bug fix): Added an option to TMW's main settings to temporarily disable the new update mechanism, reverting to the old method.
 ** (r443) Fixed SPELL_ACTIVATION_OVERLAY_GLOW_HIDE typo.
 ** (r451) {{{TellMeWhen-enUS.lua:404: nesting of [[...]] is deprecated near "["}}}
 ** (r452) The Resting condition should now properly update when entering a battleground/dungeon/etc while resting, and vice-versa.
 ** (r453) Combat Event icons should no longer process any sound/text/animation events when their parent group is hidden.
 ** (r459) TellMeWhen-5.0.0.lua:4740: attempt to index field "OnDuration" (a boolean value)

 ** (r471) TellMeWhen-5.0.0.lua:522: attempt to index local "h" (a nil value)
 ** (r472) TellMeWhen_Options.lua:4797: attempt to concatenate local "i" (a nil value)
 ** (r476) TellMeWhen-5.0.0.lua:457: attempt to index local "h" (a nil value)
 ** (r477) Buff/debuff icons that sort or that exceed the efficiency threshold should now properly update and display the unit they check when requested
 ** (r478) CLEU icons should once again not process their events when the icon or the icon's group is hidden
 ** (r479) Attempted a fix at activation overlay borders appearing underneath the icon they are playing on

 ** (r384) The weapon enchant suggestion list should now properly display shaman enchants in zhTW clients

===v4.5.4===

 * Existing substitutions "%t" and "%f" now work in all output locations.

 * Parenthesis in the condition editor are prettier now
 * Tooltip scan conditions now use the new return values of UnitAura added in WoW 4.2, and have been appropriately renamed to "Aura Variable". The result is an increase in efficiency at the cost of a bit of accuracy in some obscure cases.

 * Reactive icons and conditions should now more accurately reflect the state of the abilities that they are checking.

 ** (r149) TellMeWhen\TellMeWhen-r147.lua:1136: attempt to index local "icon" (a nil value)

 * You can now specify a custom texture to be used for an icon.

===v4.4.0===

 * New icon type: Cooldown - Auto Shot.

 ** (r99) TellMeWhen.lua:1039 bad argument #1 to 'pairs' (table expected, got nil)
 ** (r99) Meta icons should now always inherit the proper power bar color, and icons with power bars that are checking spells/abilities with different power types (druids) should reflect this in the color.

===v4.2.1.1===
 * Fixed a bug that was breaking meta icons until config mode was toggled on and off at least once after logging in.

===v4.2.1===
 * Unit cooldowns can now be sorted by duration.
 * Buffs/debuffs that are being sorted by duration now do so across all units that are being checked instead of only within each unit.
 * Internal Cooldown icons now have the option to not reset their cooldown to full duration if they are triggered while cooling down (mainly for the Early Frost mage talent).
 * Updated COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED for 4.2.
 * When right-click-dragging icons to move them or swap them, any meta icons or icon shown conditions will now update to reflect that change.
 * Further categorized the ever-expanding condition type dropdown.

 ** Grayhoof's Scrolling Combat Text
 ** mikord's MikScrollingBattleText
 ** ckknight's Parrot
 * New Conditions:
 ** Buff/Debuff - Number of - This conditions tracks the number of a buff or debuff that are active on a unit. This is not the number of stacks, but rather the actual number of auras (3 warlocks in your raid cast 3 corruptions, etc.).
 * Bug fixes:
 ** The "On Show" icon event should no longer erroneously trigger sometimes when changing zones.
 ** Item cooldown icons use item names instead of IDs that attempt to set themselves up before the required data is available will now attempt to fix themselves once that data becomes available instead of requiring a full lock toggle.

===v4.1.4.2===
 * Bugfix: TellMeWhen.lua:620: attempt to compare string with number
 * Bugfix: v4.1.4s internal version number was about 40,000 higher than it should have been. Whoops!

===v4.1.4===
 * New profiles now default to only one group instead of ten, and new/reset groups now place themselves in the center of the screen.
 * **//IMPORTANT//**: Because of the above change, there is a (very very small) chance that some of your groups moved. I apologize for the inconvenience. If you find that a group has been moved off the screen, type /tmw options, go to that group's config, and click the button to reset the group's position.
 * You can now import and export icons in string format to other users of TMW, meaning that you can share them outside of the game or to players that you are not able to whisper.
 * Imported icons will now be upgraded as needed to fully function with your current version of TMW. Icons received from newer versions of TMW that your current version may still have an occasional error, so please always ensure that you are upgraded to the latest version of TMW before reporting an error with importing.

 ** Unit Classification (Normal, Elite, Rare, Rare-Elite, World Boss)

===v4.1.3===
 * Conditions can now be set by group
 ** IMPORTANT: Group combat, vehicle, and stance settings have migrated to conditions instead of being settings that are defined in the group options
 ** The old dual spec and talent tree settings remain as a way to prevent groups in the same spot that serve different purposes from being displayed during config when not needed.
 * New/changed conditions:
 ** Stance conditions now allow an operator to be specified. Less/greater than operators are relative to the stance's position on the slider.
 ** Unit controlling vehicle

 * Spell caching will not begin until the icon editor is opened. You can have a few framerates back.
 * Bug Fixes:
 ** Unit cooldown icons should now have the condition alpha option, and subsequently, conditions will actually work with them.
 ** (r66) TMW will still function upon updating ButtonFacade to Masque, but skinning buttons will not. This is only temporary while I sort out the changes with Masque.
 ** (r67) Fixed an infinite recursion when meta icons accidentally get looped (1 checks 2, 2 checks 3, 3 checks 1) and one of them has the 'Check sub-metas' option enabled.
 ** (r67) TMW should now be compatible with Masque (and still compatible with ButtonFacade too)

===v4.1.2===

 ** Added better checking for invalid parenthesis in conditions.

 ===v4.1.1===
 * New Condition: Unit Class

 * Implemented sounds! It should be mostly functional, but if you find anything that is breaking or not working how it probably should, open a ticket.
 * Reduced CPU usage by about 20%.
 * Alpha can now be customized for when conditions fail, or for when duration/stack requirements are not met.
 * Made the meta icon editor much prettier.

 ** (r55) Cooldowns on meta icons should properly set when the meta changes to from an icon with an active timer to one without, and then back to the first icon that has an active timer.

 ===v4.0.4===
 * Maybe fixed a really rare frame level bug with cooldowns?
 * Stance conditions work now.
 * Fixed debuff conditions.
 * Began redesigning the condition editor to make room for the options to 'group' sets of conditions with parenthesis.
 * Fixed a rare error in condition processing.
 * Fixed the "only if equipped" option for item cooldowns for the 453rd time. Why don't I just leave it alone now?

===v4.0.3===
 * For purposes of duration requirements, buffs/debuffs with an infinite duration are now considered to have a duration of 0, instead of completely ignoring this feature.
 * Meta icons now inherit the "Normal" color of the icon it is showing if you are using ButtonFacade.
 * Enhanced the overall appearance of icons in config mode. The "blank" icon texture will not appear unless you completely restart WoW.
 * New icon type: Condition Icon. This icon type is for simply checking the state of a condition. The icon can be set to a specific spell texture or texture path via the name editbox.
 * A few random bugfixes

===v4.0.2===
 * Moar efficient!
 * Ignore GCD settings are now on by default now. This shouldn't affect you if you manually disabled these options.

 * Fixed the version warnings that were spamming people and telling them that you sent them an icon
 * Groups that are anchored to other groups with higher groupIDs should now properly anchor after logging in or reloading

 * Weapon enchant icons should now properly obey the setting to be hidden when the slot is empty
 * Maybe fixed a really rare frame level bug with cooldowns?

===v4.0.1.2===
 * Groups and icons should now properly copy using the dropdown on the icon editor
 * Added some tooltips to icon types
 * Added some more name substitutions to equivalencies (so they will accept any spell named "Hex" instead of just the shaman's hex spell, etc)

===v4.0.1.1===
 * Cleaned up the condition editor

===v4.0.1 beta===
 * **IMPORTANT**: Instead of typing "raid" for units raid1 through raid25, you now must type "raid1-25". This will allow for much more flexibility, e.g. raid1-10.
 * More Efficiency! Yayyy! (New stuff, plus a fix to a bug in the icon engine that was making it check every single icon, even when they were hidden)
 * New option for icon cooldowns: Only if in bags. (Note that this is forcibly checked if 'Only if equipped' is checked, and an item that is equipped is considered to be in your bags.
 * Fixed a bunch of things that were broken
 * Many conditions! Now, handle them!
 * Fixed an issue with cooldowns looking bad on circular LBF skins
 * Overlay bars now go underneath the border of LBF skins
 * Bars and timers will be set to ignore GCD in this version. You will need to toggle this off if you don't want it. (Sorry, i screwed something up in beta9)
 * Fixed a bug that caused icons that shouldn't be shown to not be hidden when switching profiles or removing rows/columns.
 * Textures should properly reset when switching profiles.
 * Switched to SVN instead of manual file uploads, yay!
 * New feature: Suggestion list. The suggestion list will take what you type and search though all known spells/items, as well as TMW equivalencies and dispel types, to suggest what you might be looking for. For example, if you are configuring a "Spell Cast" icon type, the list will show only spells with cast times, as well as the cast equivalencies. More information regarding this feature will be in the documentation that I will hopefully start writing soon. (If someone wants to help me out with that, send me a PM)
 * Equivalencies are no longer case-sensitive.
 * Reverted failed experimentation to force spell casts to match spellIDs
 * Colors on the suggestion list should now be final (known player auras are now shown with a different color than known NPC auras - if you installed the first version of 4.0.1 beta, you may see a few wrong spells, but they will be updated the next time you see them)
 * Fixed the tooltip that appears whilst you mouseover the name editbox in the icon editor with shift held down
 * Fixed a missing translation
 * Reset your aura cache to remove incorrect entires that were put in prior to version 4.0.1 beta3
 * Spell cast conditions now allow you to specify if the cast must be interruptible.
 * Icon dropdowns for meta icons and icon shown conditions now divide the icons up by group (fix for too many icons syndrome, and to make it easier to find the one you need)

===v4.0.0 beta9===
 * Actually added mainassist and maintank to the unit dropdowns.
 * Fixed an obscure error caused by casts with no start time (this happened on Al'Akir, and only for a split second)
 * Made it impossible for the addon to destroy your settings when upgrading to beta8 from a version older than 3.0.0 after you had already upgraded one character's settings. (This wasn't happening anyway because a restart is absolutely required when upgrading to beta8 from any version)
 * Fixed an error that was causing Kong UI Hider to break with TMW installed and at least one group enabled.

===v4.0.0 beta8===
 * New condition: Resting.
 * New condition: Encounter Resource, for tracking the level of encounter-specific 'resources' like corruption on Cho'gall and sound on Atramedes.
 * New condition: Talent Tree, for specifying what talent tree must be active.
 * New conditions: Unit speed/unit run speed, for checking the current movement speed/max run speed of your target.
 * Toggling the 'Ignore Runes' setting should now properly toggle the 'Ignore Runes' setting.
 * Rune conditions should now properly save.
 * Merged the glaringly empty alpha/stacks/duration tab with the main tab.
 * The option for item cooldowns to only show if equipped is back now. Oops.
 * Fixed the bug that was causing icons to occasionally hide their texture in config mode.
 * Item cooldowns that use slotIDs should now work a little better.
 * Conditions and each icon type have been split off into their own file, so a complete restart of WoW will be needed when upgrading to this version.
 * Conditions now generate their own, single function instead of chaining a bunch of functions. They also make use of Lua's short-circuit evaluation capabilities in order to become more efficient (instead of the old way that checked EVERYTHING)
 * You can now define what talent trees must be active in order to show a group.
 * Fixed an error that was being caused by interference from Tukui.
 * "mainassist#" and "maintank#" are now valid units for TMW. Their implementation is a little unorthodox though, so the order of them is not guaranteed compared to be the same as the order in your unit frames if your unit frames display these units.
 * Added compatibility for the changes made to CLEU and pet happiness in WoW 4.1.0.
 * You can now specify which totem slots to check for totem icons, and it should now be more clear what this icon type can be used for (Totems, Non-MoG ghoul, Wild Mushrooms)
 * Implemented a much more elegant method of generating group settings.

===v4.0.0 beta7===
 * Replaced the checkbox system in the condition editor with a simpler add/remove button, and added buttons to move conditions up or down.
 * Fixed a bug that was breaking multi-state cooldown icons that used spell names.

===v4.0.0 beta6===
 * Made some efficiency improvements in the area of timers and bars; be on the lookout for things that shouldn't be happening.
 * Fixed inverted bars in several cases.
 * Buff icons now show the power bar of whatever icon is currently shown (only matters if you were checking multiple buffs with different costs).
 * The first icon of a meta icon can now be deleted if there are 2 or more total, and you can now insert another icon before the first icon.
 * Conditions should now properly save, but be on the lookout for strange things happening.
 * Fixed an error caused by meta icons checking invalid icons.
 * Fixed an error that was breaking totem icons.
 * Weapon enchants now allow you to specify specific weapon enchants (put the name that is displayed in the item's tooltip into the editbox; separate multiple enchants with ';').
 * Weapon enchant icons should now have much more functional timers displayed on them.
 * Weapon enchant icons now support cooldown bars.
 * Totem and weapon enchant icons now reverse their timers (so they wipe the bright part away rather than wiping the dark part away).

===v4.0.0 beta5===
 * You will now be alerted when a guild member logs on with a version of TMW that is newer than yours.
 * Unit cooldown icons should properly obey 'Only if seen' when using spellIDs.

===v4.0.0 beta4===
 * Rewrote the entire icon core, kinda. It could be cleaner, but at least its more efficient.
 * Many things are now cached instead of being remade every time, resulting in a reduction of garbage generation by about 1300% (yes, really)
 * Enraged has been added as a dispel type, but it is not truly a dispel type like magic and poison are, just a big list of every known enrage (from http://db.mmo-champion.com/spells/?dispel_type=9)
 * The Reset all button in the options should now update all icons.
 * The CPU efficiency of all icons has increased by a bit.
 * You can now send icons to other players that are using this version of TMW or later, and obviously you can receive icons from other players too.
 * New condition: Group type.
 * When checking a high number of buffs/debuffs (this threshold can be customized), a more efficient method of checking them will be used.
 * Choosing "Icon Type" in the icon type dropdown should now properly change the type to none rather than changing it to a meta icon.
 * The multi-state cooldown icon type has been merged with the normal cooldown icon type.
 * Removed an incorrect line from the tooltip for unit cooldown icons.
 * Added trap launcher frost trap to the CrowdControl preset.
 * Added a resize tick to the icon editor, and removed the editor scale setting from the options in favor of this resize method.

===v4.0.0 beta3===
 * Reactive icons should now properly dim when unusable and set to always show
 * Cooldown and reactive icons should now hide when checking an invalid spell (spellIDs are ALWAYS valid, names of spells you haven't learned (or pet spells if you toggle config mode without your pet out) aren't)
 * TellMeWhen's options are now a separate addon. You will need to completely restart WoW when upgrading past this version if you want to configure anything.
 * Fixed the ButtonFacade callback that I broke for some reason.
 * Fixed an error in upgrading from old versions (actually, I just removed that upgrade entirely).
 * Changed max stack and duration defaults to 10 instead of 50 and 100, respectfully.
 * Conditions now save immediately upon any change made to them, instead of only when closing or reloading the icon editor.
 * The tooltip over the name dialog that appears when you hold down a modifier key should now properly only attempt to get item names if the icon is an item cooldown icon.

===v4.0.0 beta2===
 * Pet abilities can now be dragged onto an icon.
 * Ignore Runes should no longer appear as an option for reactive icons for non-DKs.
 * The icon editor should display the proper settings for each icon type instead of always meta icon settings.

===v4.0.0 beta1===
 * Well, that was a quick jump from 3.0 to 4.0
 * New icon type: Unit cooldown. This icon type will allow you to track the cooldown of any spell of any valid unit, provided that you specify the cooldown length. Instant casts and channeled spells are guaranteed 99.9% accurate, but spells with cast times that either apply a buff/debuff or do direct damage/healing can be off by about +- 1 second because of travel time.
 * Completely revamped icon configuration. Gone is the dropdown, in is a dialog that combines all of the old dialogs (4 of them) into one. This will pave the way for many more useful settings, like some of the ones below.
 * Any icon type that can check units (buff/debuff, unit cooldown) can now check multiple units.
 * Overlay bars can now have a custom offset defined in order to show a value that is higher/lower than the actual value.
 * New option for meta icons: 'Check sub-metas'. When meta icon 1 is checking meta icon 2, meta icon 1 will show an icon that meta icon 2 did not show if it gets that far down the list without finding one to show.
 * New option for reactive icons: 'Check activation border'. When checked, the spell will be considered usable whenever the spell activation overlay in your action bars is active on the ability. (Not the pet auto-cast marching ants)
 * New option for item cooldowns: 'Only if equipped'. When checked, the icon will only show if the item is equipped.
 * New condition: 'Instance type'. Allows you to specify an instance type that you must be in (with operators, so greater than or equal to 10 player raid is basically any raid).
 * New condition: 'Swimming'. Checks if you are swimming or not
 * New condition: 'Mounted'. Checks if you are mounted or not
 * Icon spacing is now defined per group.
 * You can now manually define the anchors, offsets, scale, and frame level of a group. You can also lock the group, preventing any movement or resizing by click-and-drag (recommended if you want to keep it anchored to the top of you raid frames, or something else that moves dynamically).
 * You can now disable the warning that is printed to chat when a meta icon or a condition is checking an invalid icon.
 * You can now right-click-and-drag an icon to another icon slot in order to move or copy it.
 * You can now drag a spell from your spellbook or an item from your bags/character sheet onto an icon to quickly set it up. If an icon is already configured, the name will be appended to the end of the list of names.
 * All icon types except multi-state cooldown icons now accept multiple spells/items.
 * Chakra states are no longer supported by reactive or cooldown icons. Use a multi-state cooldown icon in order to track chakra states from now on.
 * ICD icons now check for energize effects (mana/rage/energy/etc gains).
 * Custom alpha levels for failed conditions/stacks/durations have been removed. They were causing several problems that were limiting some features.
 * Fix several buff equivalencies (Feared, Stunned, Disoriented, Silenced, Rooted).
 * Spell names should now always check in the correct order.
 * The flickering timer issue should be gone for good now.

===v3.0.4a===
 * Hide rune condition configuration properly

===v3.0.4===
 * Timers should now properly hide on buff icons with no time remaining (absent, or infinite duration)
 * Consequently, meta icons that include buff icons shouldn't be dim all the time.
 * Let's hide cooldown icons with invalid names.
 * New condition: Runes. You can select the runes that you require to be available for the icon to show.

===v3.0.3===
 * Lets make ignore runes actually have a setting in the menu.
 * Added boss 1-4 to units.

===v3.0.2c===
 * Fix item cooldowns. Oops!

===v3.0.2b===
 * Apparently UnitGUID("player") returns nil when not accessed sometime after addons have loaded. Lets make ICD icons work for real now.

===v3.0.2a===
 * Lets properly defining the alpha of ICD icons. It seems to work better when they aren't shown all the time.

===v3.0.2===
 * Ignore runes is back
 * New icon type: Internal cooldown/Spell duration. This can be used to track the internal cooldown of a talent or trinket proc, or to track the duration of a spell such as a hunter trap or mage orb or warlock infernal. More details in the tooltip in the type menu.

===v3.0.1c===
 * Fixed flickering timers

===v3.0.1b===
 * Fixed the error that was telling you that you needed a restart even after you have restarted when upgrading directly to 3.0.1a from a pre-3.0.0 version.

===v3.0.1a===
 * The 'Ignore runes' option for death knights is gone. It was breaking timers for everyone else, and somehow causing other addons to break (CoolLine)
 * The tooltip for 'Show timer number' is back!
 * Fixed group names in the copy icon/group dropdown

===v3.0.1===
 * Updated Korean localization.
 * You can now rename groups to whatever you want.

===v3.0.0===
 * Converted the entire settings system to AceDB-3.0. As such, the profile copy features that come along with it have been added to the Blizz interface options.
 * You can now copy the position and scale or a group, or an entire group, or any icon from any of your characters (that you have logged in to with this version of TMW or higher) though the icon config dropdown menu.
 * Right clicking the LDB plugin now brings up the Blizz interface options for TMW instead of a menu with settings in it.
 * All icons now use the update interval that is specified in the Blizz interface options.
 * Efficiency increases across the board.
 * Overlay bars now have a little better functionality.
 * Meta icons now properly inherit stack texts.
 * Duration checks actually work for totem icons now.
 * Weapon enchant icons that are set to hide when the slot is unequipped should actually do so now when TMW is toggled when the slot is empty.
 * Meta icons and 'icon shown' conditions that check weapon enchant icons that are set to hide when the slot is empty should now reflect this.
 * Buff/debuff icons now show the texture of the first spell in the name list when they are set to show when absent (or always).
 * On a related note, duplicate names in an icon's name list are now eliminated post-user input. This will allow you to do something like "Faerie Fire;ReducedArmor" to show the FF texture when none are present without a performance impact.
 * Groups can now be up to 20 rows by 20 columns.
 * Groups can no longer be moved off the screen.
 * You can now configure a group straight from an icon's dropdown menu.
 * You can now have an infinite number of groups. Groups can be added by pressing the "Add another group" button in the Blizz interface options panel.
 * You can now delete groups as you please. The groups with groupIDs higher than that of the deleted group will be reassigned a new groupID, and any icons that had condition or meta checks to the shifted groups will automatically be updated.
 * You can now customize the position of the stack text on icons.
 * And much, much more!

===v2.4.1===
 * You can now customize the order in which icons are checked for meta icons.
 * Cleaned up icon menus (for icon shown conditions, and the new meta icon editor).
 * Checking 'Fake Hidden' no longer forces the duration/stacks/condition alpha to zero. If you wish to use an icon in an 'icon shown' condition of another icon and the duration/stacks/conditions of the icon being checked are being checked, then their respective alpha sliders should be manually set to zero.
 * New predefined spell sets: spell casts. These can be used in a casting icon to check for common spells that you may wish to be alerted about.
 * New condition: Unit in combat.
 * The condition editor scroll bar is now hidden if it isn't needed.
 * Added a cute little icon to all of the icon dialog windows for a better indicator of what icon you are working with.

===v2.4.0===
 * Duplicate Spells Names are gone. If you put in a spellID, it will require that spellID be matched.
 * The condition editor now uses a scroll frame, and has an infinite number of conditions that do not require the max number to be changed in the interface options panel.
 * The group options are now compiled in a much smarter way. This probably won't mean much to you, but I feel really dumb for the old method.
 * New group option: hide while controlling vehicle. If checked, the group will be hidden if your action bars have change to that of the vehicle. It will not be hidden if you are a passenger in a vehicle from which you can still attack (although this is being removed from SOtA in 4.0.6 anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
 * New icon type: Multi-state CD. This icon type will allow you to properly track the cooldowns of icons with multiple states (Dark Sim, HW: Chastise, etc.) The ability being tracked must be on your action bar.
 * New icon type: Cast. Basically a cast bar in a TMW icon. Can be set to only show when a cast is interruptible, and can be shown for any unit.
 * New icon type: Meta. This allows you to select any number of other TMW icons and use one icon to show them all. The icon will be hidden if none of them are shown. In addition, icons will still be shown by a meta icon if they have fake hidden enabled.
 * New units: Arena (enemies) 1-5, and group members 1-4 (the player is not included in these, party 1 is the first party member)
 * Only settings that are relevant are defined for each icon. This should result in a performance increase.
 * Cooldowns of 1 second are now always considered to be GCDs

===v2.3.0===
 * Icons can now check against their duration remaining to determine if they should be shown
 * Alpha can be customized for for when duration and stack checks fail
 * Redid/combined the alpha/stacks/duration editor
 * Fix the bug with TMW not showing up in the Blizz interface options (hopefully)
 * Fixed a faulty warning that was telling you to use SpellIDs when switching into a spec which was tracking the cooldown of a talent in that spec
 * Slightly improved load times
 * Added some missing preset auras

===v2.2.3a===
 * Added glyph of hemo to Bleeding preset
 * Fixed an error that was breaking the interface options panel
 * Fixed another error that wasn't really breaking anything, but an error is an error.

===v2.2.3===
 * Cleaned up the icon copy dialog
 * Fixed the encoding of the French localization file
 * You can now enter duplicate spell names yourself. This can be accessed in the Blizzard interface options panel under TellMeWhen, or by typing /tmw dsn. Input the spellIDs of any abilities that have the same spell name for different effects. (Hemo bleed damage increase and glyph of hemo bleed are both just called Hemorrhage; wyvern sting sleep and wyvern sting dot are both called Wyvern Sting.
 * Slight efficiency increase
 * Fix to TexCoords out of range error.

===v2.2.2===
 * Non-MoG ghoul tracking for DKs should actually work now. Just enter the name as 'Risen Ghoul', or whatever the name of the ghoul is in your locale.
 * Stances are only displayed in the interface options menu when you have options to pick.
 * New condition: talent spec. You should still use the group talent spec settings, but this will allow you to fine tune it.
 * The condition editor continues to become beautiful!

===v2.2.1===
 * Unit Reaction checks are now a condition; it should convert automatically for you.
 * Increased CPU efficiency in many places
 * New icon type: Dark Simulacrum (experimental, should work though) (only in the type list for DKs)

===v2.2.0===
 * Fixed icon shown checks on cooldown icons (they don't rapidly flash anymore)
 * Icon shown, unit exists, and unit alive condition checks can now check the converse (icon hidden, unit doesn't exist, unit dead)
 * The LDB plugin has its own file now. A restart of WoW will be required to update to this version completely
 * The choose name, alpha, and stack dialogs have been remade.
 * Buff/debuff icons can now check for dispel types (Magic, Poison, Curse, Disease)
 * Buff/debuff icons can now check for buffs and debuffs at the same time. If 'Either' is selected, they will first check as a buff, and if it is not present, then it will check as a debuff.
 * The alpha of the icon when the icon's conditions fail can now be customized.
 * New predefined aura set: crowd control (Thanks calico0!)

===v2.1.2a===
 * Back by one man's demand: timers on weapon enchant icons. These are going to remain very dysfunctional until Blizz implements better api get the start time and duration for these, instead of just how long until it expires.

===v2.1.2===
 * New option to hide temp enchant icons when the slot is empty.

===v2.1.1===
 * Ranged weapon temp enchant tracking icons should now display your ranged weapon's icon instead of your helmet. lol.
 * Weapon enchant icons no longer support timers; this was heavily bugged, and I really don't think anyone used this anyway or they would have complained about how buggy it is.

===v2.1.0b===
 * New predefined aura set: Fear
 * Instead of flooding you with errors when you try and use a spellname for a pet ability, I yell at you and tell you how to fix it.
 * Everything else was random things with the code because I was bored.
